# Capstone Project

My senior design project that focuses on implementing ML technique for anomaly detection in BMS network traffic, especially BACnet protocol based systems. Utilized unsupervised Machine Learning clustering techniques such as the K-modes and K-means for classifying the data into either anomaly or non-anomaly. Implemented a dissimilarity scoring method called Jaccard Distancing that calculates the dissimilarity between a new input and pre-existing trained cluster centroids. If distance between cluster centroid and inputs are above a certain threshold, input is classed as anomaly. 

Made a GUI to showcase the application.
