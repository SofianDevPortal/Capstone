# Capstone Project

My senior design project that focuses on implementing k-modes clustering algorithm for anomaly detection in BMS network traffic, especially for BACnet protocol based systems. Implemented a dissimilarity scoring method called Jaccard Distancing that calculates the dissimilarity between a new input and pre-existing trained cluster centroids. If distance between cluster centroid and inputs are above a certain threshold, input is classed as anomaly. 

Made a GUI to showcase the application.
